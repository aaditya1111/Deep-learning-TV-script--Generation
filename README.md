# Deep-learning-TV-script--Generation
In this project, i'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network i'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
